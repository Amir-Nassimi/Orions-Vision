## Introduction
Orion's Vision presents a pioneering approach to real-time processing for tracking applications. Our algorithm significantly enhances processing speeds on CPUs by using individuals' coordinates and image depth. It minimizes the reliance on neural networks by utilizing them periodically, not constantly, leading to a more efficient use of computational resources.

## Algorithm Overview
Orion's Vision integrates a cutting-edge algorithm that leverages individual coordinates and image depth to dramatically enhance real-time processing speed on CPUs, reducing the dependency on neural networks by utilizing them only periodically. This method stands out for its robust ability to compensate for any network's limitations, independent of its base accuracy.

It is designed with versatility in mind, able to efficiently track a wide array of objects or individuals across diverse monitoring scenarios with minimal reliance on neural networks. A standout feature of Orion's Vision is its proficiency in not only tracking known objects but also in accurately counting 'Unknown' entities, enhancing its utility in environments where not all objects may be identifiable or registered.

Moreover, we believe in transparency and the advancement of knowledge. Therefore, while we ensure the core of our sophisticated algorithm remains proprietary, a portion of Orion's Vision's algorithm is available for public review, reflecting our commitment to contributing to the community while also safeguarding our innovative solutions.

## Features
- **Intelligent Frame Skipping**: Dynamically adjusts the frame rate, offering a balanced trade-off between speed and accuracy, thereby optimizing computational resources.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Introduces a flexible threshold parameter that adapts to detection requirements, ensuring reliable tracking even in varying conditions.
- **Optimized Frame Capture**: Tailors the frame-per-second rate for seamless integration with the processing capabilities of diverse systems.
Streamlined Model Management: Simplifies the use of advanced detection models by enforcing a standardized placement within the ./models directory, facilitating ease of access and consistency.
- **Robust Database Handling**: Employs an intelligent database management system that maintains a cap on the number of trackable entities, ensuring database integrity without compromising on the systemâ€™s performance.
- **Cross-Model Compatibility**: Designed to function with any detector or tracking model that uses distance as a similarity metric, ensuring broad application potential and ease of integration.
- **Minimal Neural Dependence**: Achieves significant efficiency by reducing the frequency of neural network computations, favoring a periodic over a constant approach.

## Installation
To install Orion's Vision, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amir-Nassimi/Orions-Vision.git
cd Orions-Vision
